    "* Do POS( part of speech) tagging of the tokens and select only significant features/tokens like adjectives, adverbs, etc.\n",
    "* Pass the tokens to a sentiment classifier which classifies the tweet sentiment as positive, negative or neutral by assigning it a polarity between -1.0 to 1.0 .\n",
